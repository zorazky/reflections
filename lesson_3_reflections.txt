When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when working with others and to have a backup just in case your machine stop working

why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with you repository?
I guess to avoid a lot of changes when you are working on local files if other person is working on the same branch
