When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when working with others and to have a backup just in case your machine stop working

------

why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with you repository?
I guess to avoid a lot of changes when you are working on local files if other person is working on the same branch

------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is to take the code from someone else and make changes on your own without affecting original code on github, clone is similar but oriented to local
and branches is useful to do features or changes that will be added to the original code after.

------

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
let you work offline

-----

how would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I guess kinda having 2 sites the live site and the test site to update code there, the hard part would be having an updated file with all team cahnges

-----

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?
when other members are working on the same feature or code section
